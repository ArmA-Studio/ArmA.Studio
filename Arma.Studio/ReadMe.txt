    Ensure that you "unblocked" the ZIP before extracting.
    Since Windows 8, Microsoft blocks applications and DLLs which are
    not signed. As signing certificates cost money (and money is by nature expensive)
    i do not have such certificates in place.
    To unblock your ZIP, follow theese steps:
    1. Locate the ZIP inside the Windows Explorer
    2. Right Click the ZIP
    3. Click on "Properties" (should always be the last entry in context menu)
    4. (Windows 8/8.1) Click on the button "Unblock"; (Windows 10) Tick the Checkbox in the very bottom of the initial tab.
    5. Continue as usual.

FAQ
    I have just a blank screen with menu items in the top
        You need to click on View and add the windows yourself.
        After once closing proper (not crashing), they will stay there.
    
    The program is not launching.
        Arma.Studio requires at least .Net Framework 4.6.1
        You may also need to unblock the ZIP before unpacking as
        modern Windows installations auto-block executables downloaded
        from the internet.
        To do that, Right-Click the ZIP file you downloaded, click on "Properties"
        (last entry) and then either tick the check-box (Windows 10) in the window that appeared or
        click on the button unblock (Windows 8/8.1).
